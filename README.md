## Motivation
The main purpose of this app is to demonstrate usage of [Dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger) and [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)

- A homescreen widget that shows your stock portolio in a resizable grid.
- Stocks can be sorted by dragging and dropping the list.
- Only performs automatic fetching of stocks during trading hours and weekdays.
- Showing graphs using [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart).

## Importing and exporting
- You can import a list of tickers by selecting **import tickers** from the settings menu. All you need is a textfile with your tickers in *comma-separated* format.
- You can also export your tickers to a file by selecting **export tickers**.
